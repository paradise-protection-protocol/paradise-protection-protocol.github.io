<h1>Eli Vanderbolt</h1>
<p>
	I'll preface this by saying if you are here and don't know what this is thats fine. You can leave, or don't. I don't care too much.<br>
	In the case you do know there; was no way I would use my real name in a public space like this.<br>
	Also note the lack of photoshop files is intentional. I do not know what personally identifying information is in them if any.<br>
	However, They could be easily included if I so chose to do so. Like this:
	<a href="./PSD-file-link-QR.zip" Project 1>
		Project 1
	</a>
	<br>
	Also I don't cover the details of how I made most of these on purpose for two reasons;<br>
	 - First, I don't remember exactly how I made them and<br>
	 - Secondly, looking at the PSD files, it was mostly just layer effects, masks and filters. nothing special or unique.<br>
	Furthermore, All the images have been compressed to save space and are not the original exports.<br>
	Lastly, I have cropped or in otherwise modified the images from the actual finished projects as I have seen fit to do so.<br>
	<br>
	As for what one my favourite is, that would probably be the Album Cover, It was really the only one where I and a good idea<br>
	of what I wanted to do and was able to execute and finish the whole thing in just a few hours.<br>
	<br>
	<h2>But in any case...<br></h2>

	<h1><br>Project 1</h1>
	This is an edit of my dog to make the image seem old / worn.<br>
	Its nothing more then a sepia colour filter over some filters.<br><br>

	<h1><br>Project 2</h1>
